Description:
We have an application with which a user is able to store copies of web server log files in a secure location.

The files are copied by the users through the Set-UID application 'backup', as the users do not have the rights required to access the secure location. The 'backup' application code is presented in the exercise.c file (attached).

(A) You are asked to identify the weaknesses of the above application. For any weaknesses that will be identified when checking the source code, your documentation should include:

i) the description of the weakness
ii) the type of weakness assigned to CWE (s)
iii) the consequences of exploiting the weakness for the application, the system and its users
iv) a suggestion to address the vulnerability that the 'backup' application developer could follow


(B) Also, to prove the criticality of the above weaknesses, you are invited to implement an application type "exploit" (it can also be a batch file) which will take advantage of some of the weaknesses you have identified in order to give a simple user access administrator level (root shell) on the shared hosting server.


The documentation of the weaknesses and the source code of the application-exploit will be the deliverable of the work.
